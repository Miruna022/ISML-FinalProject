# ISML-FinalProject
A JADE-based multi agent system that simulates a smart energy grid in real time.  It includes producer agents that generate energy, consumer agents that request it, and a grid manager agent which ensures the grid stays balanced. The agents negotiate and exchange messages to maintain stable supply and demand.
